# 🌍 Prithvi Netra

Prithvi Netra is a web-based platform that enables users to analyze, visualize, and plan for urban growth using NASA Earth observation data. The platform focuses on identifying urban challenges and supporting data-driven decision-making for sustainable city development.

## 🌐 Features

1️⃣ Urban Issue Analysis: Identify city problems like pollution, lack of greenery, urban heat islands, flood risks, and more.

2️⃣ Data Visualization: Overlay multiple NASA datasets such as temperature, air quality, vegetation (NDVI), land cover, and water quality.

3️⃣ Time-based Insights: Track changes in urban conditions over custom date ranges.

4️⃣ Custom Data Integration: Upload local datasets (CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile) to combine with satellite data for richer insights.

5️⃣ AI-Powered Queries: Ask intelligent questions like “Which neighborhoods are most affected by heat?” or “Find safe zones for building hospitals.”

6️⃣ Action Planning: Simulate interventions by adding proposed infrastructure (parks, healthcare centers, housing) and estimate impact.

7️⃣ Citizen Feedback: Include crowdsourced inputs from residents to identify problem areas.

## 💻 User Inputs
